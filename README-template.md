### What I learned

I am currently starting with React, so I forced myself to use Hooks as much as possible. Rather than using media query only, I used the UseEffect hook to manipulate the DOM according to the screen size.

I am fully aware my solution is far from being perfect and it is definitively not the most efficient one. But it helped me consolidate my knowledge of Hooks, which is my main goal at the moment.
